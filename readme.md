## Overview

### The challenge

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended
because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain
CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example
jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your
own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like
React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for
this project. Happy coding!
